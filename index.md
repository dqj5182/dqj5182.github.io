<h2>About me</h2>
I am a third-year Ph.D candidate at [SNU Computer Vision Lab](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/) advised by [Prof. Kyoung Mu Lee](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/~kmlee/) (Editor in Cheif of [TPAMI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=34)). My main research topic is 3D human reconstruction and 3D scene reconstruction towards "photo realistic" and "semantically plausible" while "accurate" reconstruction of 3D human and 3D scene around the human. During my undegraduate years, I was majoring Statistical Modeling Data Science at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/) while working on Data Mining in Social Media with [Prof. Dongwon Lee](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/dul13) from [The PIKE Group](https://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/) at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/) under collaboration with [Dr. Hye Joon Park](https://www.smeal.psu.edu/management/images/hye-joon-park.jpg/view). Also, I studied Graph Neural Networks & Transformer models at [KAIST Vision & Learning Lab](https://vllab.kaist.ac.kr/) with [Prof. Seunghoon Hong](https://maga33.github.io/) as Visiting Student Researcher.
