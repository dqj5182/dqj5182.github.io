<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

I am a third-year Ph.D candidate at [SNU Computer Vision Lab](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/) advised by [Prof. Kyoung Mu Lee](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/~kmlee/) (Editor in Cheif of [TPAMI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=34)). Before joining [SNU](https://en.snu.ac.kr/), I finished my undergradute degree at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/) and had a wonderful experience at [KAIST Vision & Learning Lab](https://vllab.kaist.ac.kr/) with [Prof. Seunghoon Hong](https://maga33.github.io/). Also, I worked closely with [Prof. Dongwon Lee](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/dul13) from [The PIKE Group](https://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/) at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/) under collaboration with [Dr. Hye Joon Park](https://www.smeal.psu.edu/management/images/hye-joon-park.jpg/view). (Fun fact: I am [Euler](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/l/Leonhard_Euler.htm)'s 14th-generation acamedic descendant according to [MGP](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/index.php)!)
