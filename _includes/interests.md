## Research Interests

How far away we are to each other, we always wish to be near our loved ones. My great passion lies in connecting us as if we are together in a same place. In order to realize this, it is important to enable "photo-realistic" and "semantically plausible" while "accurate" reconstruction of 3D human and 3D scene around the human. The final goal of my research sits in this dream "connecting people together". Under this mission, my current research interests are as follows:

- **3D Human Reconstruction:** How to reconstruct human from a monocular RGB image/video?
- **3D Scene Reconstruction:** How to create 3D scene based solely on vision input?
